This is the code repository for the industrial maintenance group 1

This flask app can be ran from your local computer. You just need to do a couple things. 

If you are on a windows computer, you need to type in the command prompt: 

```
set FLASK_APP = main.py
```

If you are using mac or linux, you will need to use `export` instead of `set`

You can then run flask which automatically loads the python script and starts the local server.

To run the flask app you need to type either:

```
python -m flask run
```
or 
```
flask run
```

When it runs, you should see an ip address that you can access the server from.

Make sure that in "main.py" that the code `WEB_APP` is set to `False`.

~~The webapp might be running.If it is, you can find it at http://imsp21g1.online/.  As of Fri 21-May-21 05:24 PM, the app just puts the uploaded picture in the webpage. More work will be done for the page.~~

I found out that the website does not cost any money since it has so few users, so it will just continuously be running. You can find it anytime at http://imsp21g1.online/.
