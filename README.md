This is the code repository for the industrial maintenance group 1

This flask app can be ran from your local computer. You just need to do a couple things. 

If you are on a windows computer, you need to type: 

```
set FLASK_APP = main.py
```

If you are using mac or linux, you will need to use `export` instead of `set`

You can then run flask which automatically loads the python script and starts the local server.

To run the flask app you need to type either:

```
python -m flask run
```
or 
```
flask run
```
